# Clean-ups

Clean-ups are a recurring monthly volunteer led event with the goal to keep our estate clean.

Volunteers gather at the entrance of the estate, usually on the first Sunday of every month at 11 AM, where they meet with other volunteers and receive the necessary supplies (plastic bags, gloves and litter pickers) for carrying out the cleaning. 

The event is self-paced and usually last for 1 hour. At the end of the event, volunteers gather again at the entrance of the estate so we can take a picture of the outcome of our effort and dispose of the garbagge accordingly.

Keep an eye on Shackleton's Whatsapp groups for reminders of upcoming clean-ups.

Case the clean-up schedule doesn't suit your own for whatever reason, make sure to reach out to our organizers and they will gladly provide you the necessary supplies so you can run your own individual clean-up whenever it suits you.
