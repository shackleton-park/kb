# Clean-ups

Clean-ups are a volunteer led monthly recurring event with the goal to keep our estate clean and make a positive impact in our environment.

Volunteers gather at the meeting point (estate entrance), usually on the first Sunday of every month at 11 AM, where they meet with the rest of the group and grab the necessary supplies (plastic bags, gloves and litter pickers) for carrying out the activity.

The activity consist in picking up the litter scattered across our estate and runs for approximately 1 hour. At the end of the event, volunteers regroup at the meeting point to take a picture of the outcome of our effort and dispose of the garbagge collected appropriately.

Keep an eye on our community WhatsApp groups for reminders of upcoming clean-ups. Additionally, if the event schedule doesn't suit your own (regardless of the reason) but you still want to participate, make sure to reach out to our organizers so they can provide the necessary supplies for individual clean-ups.
